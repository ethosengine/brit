# Parity Matrix — git ↔ gix

Top-level command-level status. Per-flag status lives inside each `tests/journey/parity/<cmd>.sh`. See root `CLAUDE.md` for loop structure.

Legend:
- `absent` — no gix implementation
- `partial` — some flags / modes implemented, not all; has a `tests/journey/parity/<cmd>.sh` with TODO rows
- `present` — full parity claimed AND verified by `@gix-steward`
- `deferred` — hard system constraint only; operator-approved

## Porcelain

| git | gix | Status | Parity file | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| push | gix push | present | [push.sh](../../tests/journey/parity/push.sh) | happy-path + error-path parity across the full documented flag surface (68 green `it` blocks across 48 sections); sha256 remotes, actual lease-mismatch / force-if-includes enforcement, non-default receive-pack programs, actual push-option transmission, push-cert generation, submodule-push, and live-TCP `-4`/`-6` family selection documented in the push.sh header as deferred follow-ups |
| pull | gix pull | absent | — | composes fetch + merge |
| fetch | gix fetch | present | [fetch.sh](../../tests/journey/parity/fetch.sh) | happy-path + error-path parity across the full documented flag surface (89 green `it` blocks across 61 sections); sha256 remotes, --shallow-exclude protocol-error alignment, --unshallow happy-path (stateful, needs per-binary fixture reset in expect_parity), --negotiate-only happy-path (needs ack-only-capability enforcement in gix-protocol), and --multiple positional re-dispatch are documented in the fetch.sh header as deferred follow-ups |
| clone | gix clone | present | [clone.sh](../../tests/journey/parity/clone.sh) | happy-path + error-path parity across the full documented flag surface (1 top-level section header + 48 flag-scoped title sections; expect_parity + expect_run assertions, sha256 skipped via only_for_hash); the following rows are documented `shortcoming`s: `--revision` and its two conflict rows (vendor-only, system git 2.47 rejects it), `--depth=0` non-positive (Clap `Option<NonZeroU32>` rejects at parse-time exit 2 vs git's 128 fatal), `--shallow-since` and `--shallow-exclude` (gix-protocol shallow/deepen-not decoder gaps, same as fetch.sh), `--reference`/`--reference-if-able`/`--dissociate` (gix doesn't write `objects/info/alternates`), and `-b/--branch=<name>` (Clap field + ref_name routing wired, but the "remote branch not found" exit-code is 1 vs git's 128 pending gix::clone::Fetch error-kind mapping) |
| merge | gix merge | partial | — | exists; CLI surface incomplete |
| rebase | — | absent | — | stub crate `gix-rebase` exists |
| reset | — | absent | — | — |
| commit | — | partial | — | `Commit` subcommand exists; hook support missing |
| status | gix status | partial | — | exists; flag coverage unverified |
| log | gix log | partial | — | exists; flag coverage unverified |
| diff | gix diff | partial | — | exists; flag coverage unverified |
| show | — | absent | — | — |
| blame | — | partial | — | `Blame` subcommand exists (plumbing) |
| add | — | absent | — | — |
| rm | — | absent | — | — |
| mv | — | absent | — | — |
| checkout | — | absent | — | — |
| switch | — | absent | — | — |
| restore | — | absent | — | — |
| branch | gix branch | partial | — | exists as `Branch` subcommand |
| tag | gix tag | partial | — | exists as `Tag` subcommand |
| stash | — | absent | — | — |
| cherry-pick | — | absent | — | — |
| revert | — | absent | — | — |
| bisect | — | absent | — | — |
| notes | — | absent | — | stub crate `gix-note` exists |
| worktree | gix worktree | partial | — | exists as `Worktree` subcommand |
| submodule | gix submodule | partial | — | exists as `Submodule` subcommand |
| remote | gix remote | partial | — | exists as `Remote` subcommand |
| config | gix config | partial | — | exists as `Config` subcommand |

## ein — brit-native workflow tool (no git parity target)

`ein` commands are brit-native; they have no git counterpart and are **out of parity-loop scope**.

| ein command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| ein init | init repository |
| ein tool organize | consolidate git repos into a tidy directory tree |
| ein tool find | locate git repos recursively |
| ein tool estimate-hours | estimate contributor time from commit history |
| ein tool query | object-graph queries |
